**OpenNote WordPress Theme**
- - -
I originally hacked up this theme because I wanted a “personal database/dumping ground/thought collector” that was fast and clean. The original theme that I modified was written by Shlomi Noach and is was available at [openark.org][1].
I recommend using the [Inline Editor][2] plugin to make editing posts easier as well as [Postie][3] to allow quick emails to be posted. You may also find the just-released [Post-Forking plugin][4] helpful as well.

If you find any bugs or have comments, please let me know.
